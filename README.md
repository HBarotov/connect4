## Connect4 Game with Pygame!

This is a solved board game. The original playlist is [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFCB5Dp81iNV_inzM-R9AKkZZlePCZdtV&feature=shared) by *Keith Galli*

I tried improving the game using classes, functions, and others. I plan to add new features, especially play against the computer, in the future.
